# Photos Storage Server

This project is essentially an improved(?) clone of Google Photos developed for my personal use.<br>
It is very similar to Google Photos, but I cut out the stuff that I didn't like.<br>
It is a server, attached to my home network, that stores and displays my photos and videos.<br>
It uses MySQL as the DBMS, and C# and Blazor for everything else.<br>
I actually began working on this in the Summer of 2021, but I have been planning and testing stuff since
October 2020.
