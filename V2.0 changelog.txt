New Features
Upload page now has big text saying if there are no items in pss_upload to add to library.
You can now rename files in View Item.
You can now delete individual items in GPO Import and Upload Apply.

Improvements
Overhauled database.
	Removed media_trash and album_entries_trash tables. media and album_entries now have an extra column for storing trash info instead of moving the rows between tables. This should hopefully be faster.
	album_entries now stores the uuid of each item instead of its short path.
	date taken is now nullable and if it's null, the item will not be displayed in the main page, and there are extra settings in AV for controlling how they are shown and displayed. The default DT value for an item without a DT is now no longer DateTime.Now, but rather `null`.
	Actually using foreign keys and references now, which should hopefully make code and DB work simpler, better, and faster.
	In Connection, every NpgsqlCommand and Reader now use the 'using' keyword in C#.


Replace some repetitive code for getting file paths with a single slick method.
Remove last remaining fragments of scp crap.
Remove old Metadata.cs class and replace it with DateTakenExtractor, my Nuget package for reading/writing Date Taken metadata for photos and videos.

Changes
Renamed Connection.UAFile to UploadFile, since GPO uses it too.

Fixes
The status <span> in GPO and UA should work better/actually work now.
View Item page title is now "View Item - PSS" instead of just "View".
In Upload, fix button text saying "Go to Upload Apply" instead of "Go to Apply Upload".
