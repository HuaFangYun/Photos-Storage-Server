Todo/goals:
less CSS repetition
	make classes for icon buttons
	"" for icon and text buttons
	put in shared.CSS

at the same time fix CSS for icon buttons and possibly text/icon buttons and make sure everything is perfectly centered, etc.

make settings buttons look like buttons elsewhere. Also add this to starred:
button:hover {
    background-color: var(--hover-color);
}


remove any weird webkit things like -webkit-transform: translate(-50%, -50%); etc

remove
	font-family: Product Sans, serif; from everywhere except shared
	and maybe color: white from all the * selectors
