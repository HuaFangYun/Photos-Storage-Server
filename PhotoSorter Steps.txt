PhotoSorter Steps
-----------------
For each dir to add:
    Check if in DB. Some kind of select statement?
        DBMS should throw an error since dir is primary key. //TODO: try this
        Might need to handle this manually
        Regardless, skip to next dir if duplicate

    If not in DB
        Sort
            Create List<> of photos that need user's attention. //Probably list of strings

            Get when the thing was taken
            if cannot determine when taken:
                Add to list of ones needing attention

            if can:
                Generate new dir; move there
                Add this to the DB. Add dir, date added, date taken, etc.

        If there is any thing in that list:
            Generate another list to track what user checked
            Generate pop-up or something. At the top, add a date/time picker, and a confirm button.
            Add this in the pop-up for each item:
                Place checkbox and the name of the photo next to the checkbox. Also a smol preview of each and/or the ability to view the whole image next to each.

            While first list is not empty:
                Ask user to check items to fix
                    Ask user to enter new date/time (probs don't modify metadata, just store the user-supplied date in DB). Default the date picker to DateTime.Now. After pressing confirm, reset to .Now()

                For each item in checked list:
                    Generate new dir; move there
                    Add this to the DB. Add dir, date added, date taken, etc.
                    Remove item from both lists
