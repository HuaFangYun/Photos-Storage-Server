PhotoSorter Steps
-----------------
For each dir to add
If in DB
    Check if in DB. Some kind of select statement?
    DBMS should throw an error since dir is primary key. //TODO: try this
    Might need to handle this manually

If not in DB
    Sort
        Get when the thing was taken
        Generate sorted dir
        Move there
        Add this to the DB. Add dir, date added, date taken, etc.
